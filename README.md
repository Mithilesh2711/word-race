# Instructions

New words will be displayed one by one.
                        
You have to type the words as fast as you can.

For every missed word, your health meter will become more reddish.

Once the meter is fully red, Game is Over!

For every correct typing, multipler increases by 1.1 times and for missed one it is reset to default value.

As score increases, level increases.

NOTE: Make sure Internet connection is on.
